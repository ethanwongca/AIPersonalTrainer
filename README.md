# AI Personal Trainer
This code records the amount of bicep curls, pushups and squats. <br>
The objective of this project was to learn some computer vision along with applying some linear algebra to calculate angles of specific exercises. 

<h2> Libraries and Languages </h2>
OpenCV, Mediapipe, Numpy, and Python 3

<h2> Different Projects </h2>

<h3> Bicep Curls </h3>
In this project I used OpenCV to record the amount of bicep curls I could do, in this project the stage of my arm and also the count is shown. <br>

<strong> This is my arm going up </strong> <br>

<h3> Push Up Counter </h3>
By readjusting the angles it is easy to make a pushup counter as well using OpenCV and Numpy. Here are screenshots of the results. <br>
