# AI Personal Trainer
This code records the number of bicep curls, pushups and squats. Videos of the code working are provided in each file with the .mov file <br>
<h2> Objectives </h2>
The objective of this project was to learn some computer vision, with OpenCV and Mediapipe, along with applying some linear algebra to calculate the angles of specific exercises. 

<h2> Libraries and Languages </h2>
OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, and Python 3

<h2> Different Projects </h2>

<h3> Bicep Curls </h3>
In this project, I used OpenCV to record the amount of bicep curls I could do; in this project, the stage of my arm and the count is shown. <br>

<strong> This is my arm going up </strong> <br>

<h3> Push Up Counter </h3>
By readjusting the angles, it is easy to make a pushup counter using OpenCV and Numpy. Here are screenshots of the results. <br>

<h3> Squat Counter </h3>
A squat counter could be recreated by readjusting the angles again, but this time including the landmarks of the hip, knee, and ankle.

Anyways enjoy the project!
